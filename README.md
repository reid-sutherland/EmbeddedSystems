# Embedded Systems
All of my assignments from Embedded Systems, which include quite a bit of coding.
Assignment1: I wrote a Python-style command-line application in C which performs basic math operations and stores variables.
Assignment2: Mastermind board game implemented in C using multiple synchronized SMs.
Assignment3: Music player which takes in strings of note combinations, stores them into single bytes, then stores each song as an array of note bytes, and can playback songs on an Arduino Piezoelectric speaker. User can cycle through menu options, search for songs, and create new songs.
